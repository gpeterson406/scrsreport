scrsreport adds a SCRS statistical report template to [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) (>= 1.1.28) when 
you click "New Project... -> New Directory". It creates a bookdown skeleton with
gitbook (HTML) and pdfbook (PDF) templates matched with SCRS report templates
originally created in 2016. This will help all reports have a consistent,
professional look, as well as utilizing the benefits of bookdown (which is an
enhanced version of R Markdown) including cross-referecens (section, figures, 
tables), citations, and math equations.
